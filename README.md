# Confectionarium-Backend  

Description: The backend to my mock MERN stack website.  

Technologies used: Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, and many NPM packages.  

Credit: Jonas Schmedtmann for a significant portion of code from his Udemy course I coded along with. Although, I made my own changes to understand how it works such as modifying the schema.
